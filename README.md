# Parkinson_Disease_Detection
Parkinson's Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithm. Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive central nervous system disorder characterized by tremors, vocal cord disorders, bradykinesia, and slurred, slow speech. After Alzheimer's disease, it is the second most prevalent neurological disorder
